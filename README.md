# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this program is to create a random password generator that the user can interact with to specify which characters they want to use. The password can contain any uppercase or lowercase letters; numbers; and special characters; and can contain between 8-128 characters total.

- the reason for this project was to provide others with the ability to generate completely random and secure passwords which they can save to their own computer.
- this solves the problem of having to come up with your own password, which might not be as secure.
- this project was to demonstrate my learning with functions and arrays in JavaScript

## Installation

this project runs as a web application which can be accessed through any standard web browser

## Usage

First the user is prompted to choose how many characters they would like their password to contain: between 8-128

then the user is prompted to select between 4 options as to whether or not they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

based off of user input, the generator will then create a series of randomized characters to the length the user specified.
